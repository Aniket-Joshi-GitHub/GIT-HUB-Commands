We tell git we want to add a remote branch using the git remote command syntax:
git remote add name https://url.git

By convention, we call this remote branch the origin branch.
git remote add origin https://url.git

You then replace the .git URL with the .git URL from the repository you created.



We wonâ€™t use these commands in the video, but just in case you need them in the future:
git remote rename <old> <new>
git remote remove <name>


We tell git to push to the remote main/master branch called origin with the command:
git push -u origin main/master
