We tell git we want to add a remote branch using the git remote command syntax:
git remote add name https://url.git

By convention, we call this remote branch the origin branch.
git remote add origin https://url.git

You then replace the .git URL with the .git URL from the repository you created.



We won’t use these commands in the video, but just in case you need them in the future:
git remote rename <old> <new>
git remote remove <name>


We tell git to push to the remote main/master branch called origin with the command:
git push -u origin main/master

How to rename the branch 
git branch -m new-branch-name
