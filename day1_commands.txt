How can we create a Git Repository?
git init
This command initializes a Git Repository on your local machine.
You only need to run this command once per project.

git status
This command will report back the status of your Git repository.

git clone
use git clone to clone it to our local computer.

Clone Syntax with PAT:
git clone https://token@github.com/account/repo.git

git clone https://github.com/account/repo.git
